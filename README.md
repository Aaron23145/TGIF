# TGIF

A web site that consumes the [ProPublica Congress API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api). It allows you to view members of the congress and filter them in many ways. Also generates statistics based on the same data.

Try it live here: [TGIF on the Github Pages](https://aaron23145.github.io/TGIF/).

## Features

- Visualization of updated congress data.
- Filtering members data by state, party and custom search field.
- Sorting members alphabetically (a-z or z-a).
- Statistics generation based in engagement and party loyalty.

## Installation and deployment

No previous configuration is needed. Only a static server is needed to ensure its expected behavior.
